        <h2>Challenges Along His Way</h2>
        <div class="sticky-notes challenges">
            <div class="sticky-note">
                <p>Nikola Tesla was an extraordinary inventor who obtained around 300 patents worldwide for his inventions. Some of Tesla's patents are not accounted for, and various sources have discovered some that have lain hidden in patent archives. Many inventions developed by Tesla were not put into patent protection.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sticky-note">
                <p>In 1895, his <i>Manhattan laboratory</i> was devastated by a fire, resulting in the loss of his valuable notes and prototypes.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sticky-note">
                <p>A demonstration at <i>Madison Square Garden</i> in 1898 showcased the wireless control of a boat, which was met with skepticism.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sticky-note">
                <p>He shifted his focus to the wireless transmission of electric power, envisioning global electricity distribution and communication. To test his ideas, he established a laboratory in <i>Colorado Springs</i>. During one of his experiments, he drew an extraordinary amount of power, causing a regional power outage.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sticky-note">
                <p>In <i>Colorado Springs</i>, he also claimed to have detected signals of potential extraterrestrial origin.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sticky-note">
                <p>In 1901, he secured funding from J.P. Morgan to construct a tower on Long Island to demonstrate global electrification. Morgan later withdrew support.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sticky-note">
                <p>In 1909, Marconi received the Nobel Prize for radio development, leading Tesla to sue Marconi for patent infringement in 1915.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sticky-note">
                <p>Rumors circulated in 1915 that Edison and Tesla might share a Nobel Prize, though this did not come to fruition.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sticky-note">
                <p>Throughout his life, Tesla received numerous honors and awards, including the American Institute of Electrical Engineers "Edison" Medal, which ironically recognized his achievements.</p>

        <h2>The Final Years of His Life</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>In the realm of public perception, Tesla assumed the role of an eccentric scientist.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>He asserted the creation of a motor fueled by cosmic rays and embarked on exploring an unconventional physics, distinct from Einstein's theories, promising a novel energy source.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Among his eclectic claims was the development of a pioneering technique to photograph thoughts, and the conception of a ray technology, known variably as the death ray or peace ray, speculated to possess military superiority beyond Nobel's weaponry.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Financially destitute, Tesla's later life was characterized by transient residencies and unresolved debts.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>His final years led him to a New York hotel, where Westinghouse aided him in covering rent expenses.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>An avid loner, he frequented a nearby park, notably nurturing a peculiar bond with pigeons, which he believed he shared a unique affinity with.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>On January 7, 1943, Tesla passed away at the age of 86, discovered deceased in his hotel room by a maid.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In the modern era, the name Tesla retains its prominence.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>His legacy extends to the Belgrade airport bearing his name, the renowned electric car brand, and the unit of measurement for magnetic field strength in MRI scanners.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Much like Prometheus from Greek mythology, Tesla ventured to harness celestial forces, likening his feats to Prometheus' theft of fire for humanity, while facing his own trials and tribulations, ultimately leading to isolation and financial challenges.</p>
